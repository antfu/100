## Join us!

[@octref](https://github.com/octref)(100.matsu.io) and me started our 100-day challenges as we wanted to learn creative coding while having fun.

We would love to share the journey with you and have you learning and doing sketches together. **Join us in [Codecember](https://codecember.netlify.app/)**,
we'll give you a prompt every day that includes an artwork, its source code and a blurb, throughout December, 2020.
